### Hi there, you found my profile! 👋

I'm Lucas, a web developer with over a decade of experience wrangling PHP and making magic happen with frameworks like Laravel and Symfony. I’m a huge fan of open-source, and I've had the chance to contribute to some pretty cool projects like Laravel Core, Pest PHP, and Filament PHP. When I'm not knee-deep in code, you might catch me sharing my thoughts at meetups and conferences like 🇵🇹 [Laracon EU 2023](https://laracon.eu), 🇬🇧 [Laravel Live UK 2023](https://laravellive.uk), 🇧🇪 [FullStack EU 2023](https://fullstackeurope.com/2023) and 🇩🇰 [Laravel Live DK 2024](https://laravellive.dk).

By day, I'm the Engineering Team Lead at [Worksome](https://worksome.com), where I get to lead an awesome team of developers. With previous gigs as a Team Lead and CTO, I've got a pretty solid handle on team management—aka making sure we ship on time and have fun doing it.

I'm always on the lookout for new things to learn and ways to push the boundaries of what we can build on the web.
