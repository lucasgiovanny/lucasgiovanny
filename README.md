### Hi there, you found my profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced web developer with over a decade of experience in PHP and frameworks such as Laravel and Symfony. I am passionate about contributing to open source projects and have also had the opportunity to speak at conferences such as Laracon EU 2023 in Lisbon.

With a strong understanding of design patterns, automated testing, and continuous integration and deployment, I pride myself on delivering high-quality solutions and collaborating effectively with my team. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills in web development and am committed to delivering exceptional results.
